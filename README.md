## Course Overview
Senior design courses allow senior-level students to integrate their software engineering knowledge and produce a useful engineering artifact. The course sequence consists of two semesters:

### CptS 421 - Software Design Project I (Fall)
**Focus**: Initial project planning and development.  
**Activities**:
- Formation of design teams.
- Interviewing sponsors.
- Starting the design process and project development.
- Completion of a series of assignments resulting in written documents, audio/visual presentations, and an alpha prototype implementation.

### CptS 423 - Software Design Project II (Spring)
**Focus**: Finalizing and delivering the project.  
**Activities**:
- Documenting the latter phases of the project.
- Completing, testing, and delivering the project design.
- Presenting the final software product to external constituencies such as industry representatives, other students, and faculty.

**Note**: CptS 423 also satisfies the CAPS requirement for WSU’s University Common Requirements (UCORE), focusing on applying skills, concepts, and methods of inquiry from general education and the major to a culminating project.

## Graded Components

### CptS 421 (Fall Semester)
- **Project Report**: Subdivided into multiple sections during the term.
- **Team Monthly Sprint Reports**: Each month, the team shall produce a progress report for their client, mentor, and LMS.
  - **Note**: Failure to produce this report shall result in an immediate fail for the team in the term.
- **Individual Course Needs**: Resume/bio, getting access to GitHub, and attending class as required.
- **Sprints**: Codebase evaluation.
- **Personal Contributions to Team Outcomes**:
  - Reviewed in several areas, scored on the 0..3 + N/A scale:
    - Communication
    - Project Management
    - Engineering Development Efforts
    - Client Interaction
    - Documentation & Design Efforts
  - **Class Requirements**:
    - Attitude and Engagement

### CptS 423 (Spring Semester)
- **Poster Presentation**: Presenting the project poster during Weeks 13 or 14.
- **Client Demo**: Presenting the design and prototype to the mentor/sponsor during Week 16 (Dead Week).
- **Sprints**: Codebase and repo engineering process evaluation, demo videos, sprint reports.
- **Personal Contributions to Team Outcomes**:
  - Continuation of evaluation in areas such as:
    - Communication
    - Project Management
    - Engineering Development Efforts
    - Client Interaction
    - Documentation & Design Efforts
  - **Class Requirements**:
    - Attitude and Engagement

### Peer Grading
Intermittently, each student may fill in and submit a "peer evaluation" form. Students will be asked to provide feedback about the contributions of their teammates to the project based on the total effort contributed by the team members. They will report the percentages of contributions of each team member. Individual contributions and feedback from team leads shall be part of the consideration of an individual’s work for the term.

The instructor reserves the right to adjust the peer evaluation scores if the instructor and the mentor agree that the scores were prejudiced (either too high or too low).

## Grading Weights for the Graded Components
The following weights are tentative and subject to change as the semester progresses. Updates to the weights and rationale for the change will be announced via the LMS announcements.

### CptS 421 (Fall Semester)
- **Individual Assignments**: 1%
- **Project Report**: 20%
- **Sprints**: 30%
- **Presentation Assignments**: 19%
- **Peer and Client Assessment**: 30%

### CptS 423 (Spring Semester)
- **Poster Presentation**: 15%
- **Project Report**: 20%
- **Sprints**: 25%
- **Client Demo**: 15%
- **Peer and Client Assessment**: 25%

## Grading Schema
Maybe subject to curving. Any changes to the grading schema will be announced via the LMS.

- **A**: 100% to 94.0%
- **A-**: < 94.0% to 90.0%
- **B+**: < 90.0% to 87.0%
- **B**: < 87.0% to 84.0%
- **B-**: < 84.0% to 80.0%
- **C+**: < 80.0% to 77.0%
- **C**: < 77.0% to 74.0%
- **C-**: < 74.0% to 70.0%
- **D+**: < 70.0% to 67.0%
- **D**: < 67.0% to 64.0%
- **D-**: < 64.0% to 61.0%
- **F**: < 61.0% to 0.0%

## Key Components of Capstone
Deliver to your client and contribute to your team. The fastest ways to slip to ‘1’ scores are to:

- Not communicate with your team.
- Missing too many deadlines with your work units.
- Generating no code.
- Not being proactive in working on your project.

**If your team doesn’t know what you’re doing, or you cannot finish work on time, then you’ll be in danger of not passing this class. We’re in computer science and software engineering.**

**The #1 thing you must be able to demonstrate is the ability to address a need in the project, personally decide on a solution, and persevere until you’ve created a working solution: "No Code. No Commits. No Degrees."**
